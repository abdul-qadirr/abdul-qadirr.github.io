I am a Geospatial Data Scientist and Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) fellow. I will be working with NASA HARVEST as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) specialist for agriculture monitoring from December, 2023. I utilize statistical and machine learning-based methods to extract insights from remote sensing data. I construct pipelines that deliver metrics from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and other satellite imagery. Additionally, I utilize causal inference to assess the impact of climate and human-induced changes on agriculture and natural resources. My objective is to assist decision-makers and the scientific community in formulating informed policies pertaining to natural resources and food security concerns.

I completed my Phd in Geographical Sciences in October 2023 from Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland-College Park. My Phd thesis was on
"SAR based spatial modelling and generalization approach for crop monitoring in data sparse regions of the world". During PhD, I developed a physics-guided Machine Learning (ML) based model for sunflower crop mapping and generalization in Ukraine and Russia. Based on this model, I assessed and quantified the impact of Russian aggression on sunflower crop in Ukraine.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
