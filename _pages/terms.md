Other than geospatial remote sensing, I am very much passionate about investing and consider it to be my *Ikigai*. During my Phd, I read lots of investing books which also helped me to refresh and cope better with the Phd stress. I strongly believe that there is a connection between Phd research and investing and if you are good researcher then you can be a good investor too. I recommend youngsters to make a habit of investing to have another source of income to create long term wealth and to achieve financial freedom.

Here are some of the books which I have complied for anyone who are looking to learn more about investing in stocks.

Research vs Investing similarity

Both spend considerable amount of time conducting research on the Phd topic, on companies
Both predict the future, research formulate their own hypothesis, investor predict the companies future earnings






Here are some resources I've compiled for students or others looking to learn more about remote sensing, machine learning, etc.
