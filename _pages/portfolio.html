<h2><b> Physics guided ML based model for crop monitoring using SAR </b></h2>

<img style="float: right; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;" src="https://abdul-qadirr.github.io/images/directional_sunflower_maize.png" width=400>
In this study, I developed a model based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery and machine learning to identify, spatially and temporally map sunflower crops in Ukraine between 2018 and 2022 without the use of field labels. Then combined this sunflower map with the statistical method of the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to estimate the causal effect of the war on sunflower crops in the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. This work also taught me to collaborate with team members during war time, delivering end products on time and supporting government and non-government organizations.

<h2><b> Monitoring forest degradation in South Asia using multi source satellite data  </b></h2>
<img style="float: right; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;" src="https://abdul-qadirr.github.io/images/forest-degradation.png" width=300>

</div>

In this work, I developed a machine learning based classification model by combining SAR and optical data to capture forest degradation signals in two protected sites in India and Sri Lanka. The classification model was able to generate accuracy of > 95% to identify non-intact forest within the protected areas. This assessment contributed towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator of 15.1.1 and 15.1.2.

<h5>Research project, <span class="w3-opacity"> April, 2019 - Ongoing </span></h5> </div>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
<p>This is an ongoing project at King's College London at the interactionLAb. We are focused on studying methods to enable collaborations between human and robots in agricultural settings. Among the multiple research outputs, our studies show how to improve human opinion towards robot ro-workers. For more information about these topics you can take a look to our <a href="https://adrianxsalazar.github.io/publications/">publications</a>. Within this project, I am particularly interested in adapting computer vision algorithms to make them trustworthy.</p>

<h5> Master thesis project, <span class="w3-opacity"> January 2019 - August 2019 </span></h5> </div>

<div class="w3-container">
<p>This is my final master project with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zzLBKmgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Michael Brendam</a> at King's College London. This project evaluates the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of 3D structures. Then, use the learned ditributions to generate new data with the intrinsic characteristics of the original source. We show that is possible to improve the classification of 3D human representations by generating extra data using 3D GANs. Potential application of our findings lies on better human action detection systems for autonomous systems and improving the analysis of 3D medical data.</p>

<h2><b> Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A review of the literature </b></h2>

<h5> Literature review project,   <span class="w3-opacity"> October 2018 - May 2019 </span></h5> </div>
<div class="w3-container">
<p>This project involves a literature review in the area of explainable Artificial Intelligence that I made for the module "advanced research topics" with  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JSARf0MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Sanjay Modgil</a> at King's College London. Our focus was to report a comprehensive review of the trends and development in explainable Artificial Intelligence. So, other researchers can use this review as a starting point to develop explainable AI tools. </p>
