The objective of this research is to develop a model based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery and machine learning to identify, spatially and temporally map sunflower crops in Ukraine between 2018 and 2022 without the use of field labels. Then combined this sunflower map with the statistical method of the difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to estimate the causal effect of the war on sunflower crops in the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. This work also taught me to collaborate with team members during war time, delivering end products on time and supporting government and non-government organizations.

The objective of this research is to develop a machine learning based classification model by combining SAR and optical data to capture forest degradation signals in two protected sites in India and Sri Lanka. The classification model was able to generate accuracy of >90% to identify non-intact forest within the protected areas. This assessment contributed towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator of 15.1.1 and 15.1.2.You can read more about the research in this [publication](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/3/522)

<p>This is an ongoing project at King's College London at the interactionLAb. We are focused on studying methods to enable collaborations between human and robots in agricultural settings. Among the multiple research outputs, our studies show how to improve human opinion towards robot ro-workers. For more information about these topics you can take a look to our <a href="https://adrianxsalazar.github.io/publications/">publications</a>. Within this project, I am particularly interested in adapting computer vision algorithms to make them trustworthy.</p>
