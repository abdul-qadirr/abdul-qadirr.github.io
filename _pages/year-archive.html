<h2><b> Physics guided ML based model for crop monitoring using SAR </b></h2>

Other than geospatial remote sensing, I am very much passionate about investing and consider it to be my Ikigai. During my Phd, I read lots of investing books which also helped me to refresh and cope better with the Phd stress. I strongly believe that there is a connection between Phd research and investing and if you are good researcher then you can be a good investor too. I recommend youngsters to make a habit of investing to have another source of income to create long term wealth and to achieve financial freedom

Monitoring monsoon crops are challenging due to cloud cover during critical crop growth stages, landscape heterogeneity and small field sizes. The objective of this research is to develop a machine learning based model for mapping monsoon crops by fusing optical and SAR satellite data at high-resolution (10m) appropriate for different agroecological regions (AER) and small field sizes.

</div>

The objective of this research is to develop a machine learning based classification model by combining SAR and optical data to capture forest degradation signals in two protected sites in India and Sri Lanka. The classification model was able to generate accuracy of >90% to identify non-intact forest within the protected areas. This assessment contributed towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator of 15.1.1 and 15.1.2.

<p>This is an ongoing project at King's College London at the interactionLAb. We are focused on studying methods to enable collaborations between human and robots in agricultural settings. Among the multiple research outputs, our studies show how to improve human opinion towards robot ro-workers. For more information about these topics you can take a look to our <a href="https://adrianxsalazar.github.io/publications/">publications</a>. Within this project, I am particularly interested in adapting computer vision algorithms to make them trustworthy.</p>
